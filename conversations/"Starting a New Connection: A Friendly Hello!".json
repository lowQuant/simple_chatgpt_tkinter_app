    "content": "Sure! Here's a simple Python program that generates a random number guessing game. It consists of about 25 lines and demonstrates basic concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guessing_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n    \n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Enter your guess: \"))\n            attempts += 1\n\n            if guess < 1 or guess > 100:\n                print(\"Please guess a number between 1 and 100.\")\n                continue\n\n            if guess < number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n            elif guess > number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {number_to_guess} in {attempts} attempts.\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"That's not a valid number. Please enter an integer.\")\n\n    if attempts == max_attempts:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've run out of attempts. The number was {number_to_guess}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guessing_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program begins by importing the `random` module to generate a random number.\n- The `guessing_game` function contains the main logic of the game.\n- It selects a random number between 1 and 100 and then asks the player to guess the number.\n- The player has up to 10 attempts to guess the number, and the program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n- If the player runs out of attempts, the program reveals the number.\n\nYou can copy and run this code in a Python environment to play the game!"
